How To Build ServiceMatrix
===============================

In order to build NServiceBus Studio, you will need the following dependencies installed based on the Visual Studio version that you want to create:

For Visual Studio 2012:

1. Visual Studio 2012 - Professional Edition
2. Visual studio 2012 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)
3. MS Visual Studio 2012 Visualization and Modeling Tools SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30680)
4. NuPattern Toolkit Builder 1.4.24.0 - https://nupattern.codeplex.com/downloads/get/786828

For Visual Studio 2013:

1. Visual Studio 2013 - Professional Edition
2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 SDK - http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40758
3. Modeling SDK for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40754
4. NuPattern Toolkit Builder 1.4.24.0 - https://nupattern.codeplex.com/downloads/get/786828

On th Build Server 
========
The VS Build steps on TeamCity require command line params to set the path to the NuPattern components, there extension are named with a random file nam on disk so
this must be adjusted if teh build agent is changed/rebuilt or the user account changed.  The comamnd parameters look like 

/p:PatternToolkitRuntime=C:\Users\Administrator\APPDATA\LOCAL\MICROSOFT\VISUALSTUDIO\12.0\Extensions\f0g4nk5x.sh1;PatternToolkitBuilder=C:\USERS\ADMINISTRATOR\APPDATA\LOCAL\MICROSOFT\VISUALSTUDIO\12.0\EXTENSIONS\gkkzc4ak.stf

Signing of the VSIX also happens as part of build on Teamcity using an inhouse tool.  The tool expects the signing certificate to be disk, it does not us the certificate store (this will be fixed up later)
