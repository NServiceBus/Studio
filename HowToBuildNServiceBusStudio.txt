How To Build NServiceBus Studio
===============================

In order to build NServiceBus Studio, you will need the following dependencies installed based on the Visual Studio version that you want to create:

For Visual Studio 2010:

1. Visual Studio 2010 - Ultimate Edition - Service Pack 1
2. Visual studio 2010 SP1 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21835)
3. MS Visual Studio 2010 Architecture and Modeling Tools SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23025)
4. NuGet Package Manager
5. NuPattern Toolkit Builder v.1.3.14.0 for VS2010 (Internal drop - Ask Ezequiel for it)

For Visual Studio 2012:

1. Visual Studio 2012 - Ultimate Edition
2. Visual studio 2012 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)
3. MS Visual Studio 2012 Visualization and Modeling Tools SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30680)
4. NuPattern Toolkit Builder v.1.3.14.0 for VS2012 (Internal drop - Ask Ezequiel for it)

After installing prerequisites, you can run AutomatedBuild\build.bat. That will build and generate NServiceBus Studio toolkit for both Visual Studio versions (VS2010 & VS2012).

First-Time Build
================

We've made some changes to the solution in order to avoid first-time build issues. However, be sure source code files are not blocked on Windows, and are not read-only.

Basic Troubleshooting
=====================

If you get an error saying the assembly NServiceBusStudio.Automation doesn't have a strong name, then you will need to manually add the snk file. Please go to the project properties for NServiceBusStudio.Automation, in the Signing tab you will need to check "Sign the assembly" and browse for NServiceBus.Tools.snk which is either in the same project folder or in the Studio/Solution Items folder. After that you should be able to build the solution successfully.

There might be some issues if there are read-only files that need to be generated during the build. To avoid those error be sure that the files are not read-only.
